This is the official repository for our EACL paper about pre-training language models on a representative 100M-word corpus. We propose a data-efficient LM architecture (LTG-BERT) that outperforms the original BERT model. We believe that this type of modestly-sized, but representative, corpora has great potential as a language modeling benchmark.

    abstract = "While modern masked language models (LMs) are trained on ever larger corpora, we here explore the effects of down-scaling training to a modestly-sized but representative, well-balanced, and publicly available English text source {--} the British National Corpus. We show that pre-training on this carefully curated corpus can reach better performance than the original BERT model. We argue that this type of corpora has great potential as a language modeling benchmark. To showcase this potential, we present fair, reproducible and data-efficient comparative studies of LMs, in which we evaluate several training objectives and model architectures and replicate previous empirical results in a systematic way. We propose an optimized LM architecture called LTG-BERT.",
